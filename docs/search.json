    "text": "I am the author of the book Analyzing US Census Data: Methods, Maps, and Models in R, which is free to read online and is forthcoming with CRC Press in 2022.\n\nI’m an R developer actively working on the following packages:\n\ntidycensus, which helps R users get demographic & spatial data from the US Census Bureau ready-to-go for use in their analyses;\ntigris, which downloads US Census Bureau spatial data and loads it directly into R as simple features objects;\nmapboxapi, an R interface to Mapbox web services. Use the package to optimize routes, draw isochrones, read and write vector tiles, use custom Mapbox maps in Leaflet projects, and more;\ncrsuggest, which gives R users projected coordinate system suggestions for their spatial datasets.\n\n\nI’m an academic researching data science and visualization tools for spatial demography. I’m currently teaching courses in exploratory data analysis with Python and introductory Urban Studies.\n\nI am Director of Research at a boutique data science and strategy firm, where we use cutting-edge geospatial & machine learning methods to improve companies’ business outcomes.\n\nI also consult through my personal firm, Walker Data, where I work with individual clients and organizations to integrate tools like tidycensus into their workflows and to learn R and spatial data analysis.\n\nIf you are interested in working with me, send me a note at kyle@walker-data.com and let’s discuss your idea!"
