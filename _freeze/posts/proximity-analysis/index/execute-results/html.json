Analysts in fields like health care, real estate, retail, education, and more are commonly tasked with finding out what resources are near to a given location, and potentially develop strategies to fill identified gaps in resource access.  In Chapter 7 of my book _Analyzing US Census Data_, [I illustrate a workflow that shows how to analyze accessibility from Census tracts to major trauma hospitals in Iowa](https://walker-data.com/census-r/spatial-analysis-with-us-census-data.html#distance-and-proximity-analysis).  In this post, I'll show you how to reproduce the first part of that analysis in Python for the neighboring state of South Dakota.  \n\nSimilar to the section in my book, this post will cover how to calculate proximity in two ways: using straight-line (Euclidean) distances in a projected coordinate system, and using driving times derived from a hosted navigation service.  You'll learn how to compute distances using built-in tools in __geopandas__, and also use the __routingpy__ Python package to interact with Mapbox's Navigation APIs.  \n\n## Getting and formatting location data\n\nTo get started, we'll need to acquire and format data on both Census tracts and hospitals.  We can get Census tract boundaries for South Dakota using [my __pygris__ package](https://walker-data.com/pygris/); we'll then use the [`.to_crs()`](https://geopandas.org/en/stable/docs/reference/api/geopandas.GeoDataFrame.to_crs.html) method to transform to an appropriate projected coordinate reference system for the area.  \n\nThe hospitals can be read in directly from the US Department of Homeland Security's [Homeland Infrastructure Foundation-Level Data (HIFLD) portal](https://hifld-geoplatform.opendata.arcgis.com/datasets/hospitals/explore?location=36.729510%2C-96.551840%2C4.98).  HIFLD includes open, frequently-updated datasets on \"critical infrastructure\" such as schools, pharmacies, and health care facilities.  After reading in the file, we subset the data using a regular expression and `.str.contains()` to include only Level I and Level II trauma centers, and drop any duplicated records.    \n\n::: {.cell execution_count=1}\n``` {.python .cell-code}\nimport geopandas as gp\nfrom pygris import tracts\n\n# Coordinate system: State Plane South Dakota North\nsd_tracts = tracts(\"SD\", cb = True, \n                   year = 2021, \n                   cache = True).to_crs(6571)\n\nhospital_url = \"https://opendata.arcgis.com/api/v3/datasets/6ac5e325468c4cb9b905f1728d6fbf0f_0/downloads/data?format=geojson&spatialRefId=4326\"\n\n\nhospitals = gp.read_file(hospital_url).to_crs(6571)\n\ntrauma = hospitals.loc[hospitals['TRAUMA'].str.contains(\"LEVEL I\\\\b|LEVEL II\\\\b|RTH|RTC\")]\n\ntrauma = trauma.drop_duplicates(['ID'])\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n```\nUsing FIPS code '46' for input 'SD'\n```\n:::\n:::\n\n\nThe next step is to identify those trauma hospitals that are _near to_ South Dakota.  While the hospitals dataset does have a `STATE` column, we don't want to filter the dataset for only those hospitals that are located in the state.  In some cases, the nearest trauma hospital might be in a different state, and we don't want to exclude those from our analysis.  \n\nThe approach here identifies all trauma hospitals within 100 kilometers of the South Dakota border, or within the state itself.  We use a sequence of common GIS operations with __geopandas__ to accomplish this.  Our steps include:\n\n* Combining the South Dakota Census tracts into a single shape with the `.dissolve()` method;\n* Drawing a new shape that extends to 100km beyond the South Dakota border with the `.buffer()` method;\n* Using an _inner spatial join_ to retain only those trauma centers that fall within the 100km buffer shape.\n\n::: {.cell execution_count=2}\n``` {.python .cell-code}\nsd_buffer = gp.GeoDataFrame(geometry = sd_tracts.dissolve().buffer(100000))\n\nsd_trauma = trauma.sjoin(sd_buffer, how = \"inner\")\n```\n:::\n\n\nAfter running this operation, we can draw a quick plot to show the relationships between Census tracts and hospitals as in [Section 7.4.1 of _Analyzing US Census Data_](https://walker-data.com/census-r/spatial-analysis-with-us-census-data.html#calculating-distances). \n\n::: {.cell execution_count=3}\n``` {.python .cell-code}\nimport matplotlib.pyplot as plt\nimport seaborn as sns\n\nfig, ax = plt.subplots(figsize = (8, 5))\n\nsd_tracts.plot(ax = ax, color = \"grey\")\nsd_trauma.plot(ax = ax, color = \"red\")\n\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-display execution_count=3}\n```\n<AxesSubplot: >\n```\n:::\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-display}\n![](index_files/figure-html/cell-4-output-2.png){}\n:::\n:::\n\n\nThere are seven Level I or Level II trauma centers within 100km of South Dakota (in fact, all are Level II). In fact, only three are actually in the state, with two in Sioux Falls and one in Rapid City.  Three others are in North Dakota (Bismarck and Fargo) and one is just across the border in Sioux City, Iowa.  \n\n## Calculating distances to trauma centers\n\nThe simplest way to calculate proximity is with straight-line distances.  In a projected coordinate system, this amounts to little more than Euclidean geometry, and such distance calculations are readily available to us using the `.distance()` method in __geopandas__.  Conceptually, we'll want to think through how to represent polygon-to-point distances.  The most accurate approach would likely be to find the _population-weighted centroid_ of each Census tract using some underlying dataset like Census blocks.  In the example here, I'm taking a more simplistic approach by finding the geographic centroid of each tract.  The centroids are found in the `centroid` attribute of any polygon __GeoDataFrame__.  \n\nOnce the centroids are identified, we can iterate over them with `apply` and build a dataset that represents a distance matrix between Census tracts and trauma hospitals.  Distances are calculated in meters, the base unit of our coordinate reference system (State Plane South Dakota North).   \n\n::: {.cell execution_count=4}\n``` {.python .cell-code}\ntract_centroids = sd_tracts.centroid\n\ndist = tract_centroids.geometry.apply(lambda g: sd_trauma.distance(g, align = False))\n\ndist.head()\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-display execution_count=4}\n```{=html}\n<div>\n<style scoped>\n    .dataframe tbody tr th:only-of-type {\n        vertical-align: middle;\n    }\n\n    .dataframe tbody tr th {\n        vertical-align: top;\n    }\n\n    .dataframe thead th {\n        text-align: right;\n    }\n</style>\n<table border=\"1\" class=\"dataframe\">\n  <thead>\n    <tr style=\"text-align: right;\">\n      <th></th>\n      <th>2354</th>\n      <th>4440</th>\n      <th>4441</th>\n      <th>4452</th>\n      <th>5386</th>\n      <th>5387</th>\n      <th>5388</th>\n    </tr>\n  </thead>\n  <tbody>\n    <tr>\n      <th>0</th>\n      <td>179156.152185</td>\n      <td>422441.507300</td>\n      <td>422155.094660</td>\n      <td>313038.398120</td>\n      <td>490132.864570</td>\n      <td>62861.191081</td>\n      <td>61633.946651</td>\n    </tr>\n    <tr>\n      <th>1</th>\n      <td>315344.252959</td>\n      <td>276978.438522</td>\n      <td>276708.176024</td>\n      <td>254769.314501</td>\n      <td>384118.434400</td>\n      <td>208119.760220</td>\n      <td>206470.685056</td>\n    </tr>\n    <tr>\n      <th>2</th>\n      <td>275529.979201</td>\n      <td>354138.644057</td>\n      <td>353818.847981</td>\n      <td>213424.554461</td>\n      <td>495938.859489</td>\n      <td>157302.191011</td>\n      <td>156735.306982</td>\n    </tr>\n    <tr>\n      <th>3</th>\n      <td>187763.417249</td>\n      <td>408402.306426</td>\n      <td>408161.751845</td>\n      <td>362094.468043</td>\n      <td>419202.830653</td>\n      <td>107982.166667</td>\n      <td>105743.400331</td>\n    </tr>\n    <tr>\n      <th>4</th>\n      <td>655092.671279</td>\n      <td>344550.256147</td>\n      <td>344760.480163</td>\n      <td>605274.028698</td>\n      <td>87369.870363</td>\n      <td>592598.357613</td>\n      <td>590388.549939</td>\n    </tr>\n  </tbody>\n</table>\n</div>\n```\n:::\n:::\n\n\nLet's take a quick look at how distance to the nearest trauma center varies around South Dakota.  We'll use the `.min()` method to find the minimum distance to a hospital for each row, then divide the result by 1000 to convert the distances to kilometers.  We can then draw a histogram to review the distribution. \n\n::: {.cell execution_count=5}\n``` {.python .cell-code}\nmin_dist = dist.min(axis = 'columns') / 1000\n\nsns.histplot(min_dist, binwidth = 10)\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-display execution_count=5}\n```\n<AxesSubplot: ylabel='Count'>\n```\n:::\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-display}\n![](index_files/figure-html/cell-6-output-2.png){}\n:::\n:::\n\n\nOver 60 Census tracts are within 10km of a trauma center, reflecting tracts located within the population centers of Rapid City and Sioux Falls.  However, many tracts in the state are beyond 100km from the nearest trauma center, with 26 200km or more away.  \n\nWe know that in rural areas, however, straight-line distances can be misleading.  Given the geography of highway networks, accessibility to a trauma center is mediated through accessibility to that road network.  Let's take a look at an alternative approach to calculating proximity to hospitals with a hosted routing service.  \n\n## Finding travel-times to trauma centers\n\nAnalysts who need to calculate proximity along a road network in Python have multiple options available to them.  One way is to build a network using a tool like [OSMnx](https://osmnx.readthedocs.io/en/stable/); another way, shown here, is to connect to a hosted navigation service.  In _Analyzing US Census Data_, I demonstrate [how to use my __mapboxapi__ R package to calculate a travel-time matrix between Census tracts and hospitals](https://walker-data.com/census-r/spatial-analysis-with-us-census-data.html#calculating-travel-times).  In Python, we can connect to Mapbox's navigation services [with the __routingpy__ package, an interface to several hosted navigation APIs](https://routingpy.readthedocs.io/en/latest/).  \n\nIn __routingpy__, Mapbox's web services are referenced as `MapboxOSRM`.  We'll need a Mapbox account and access token to access these services; I'm storing mine in a variable named `mapbox_key`.  I then initalize a connection to Mapbox with `MapboxOSRM()`, which I am calling `mb`.  \n\n\n\n::: {.cell execution_count=7}\n``` {.python .cell-code}\nfrom routingpy.routers import MapboxOSRM\n\nmb = MapboxOSRM(api_key = mapbox_key)\n```\n:::\n\n\nIn the __mapboxapi__ R package, the processing required to prepare datasets for the Mapbox APIs is taken care of internally.  To calculate a travel-time matrix in Python, we'll need to do some data processing to format our Census tracts and hospitals in the correct way before we send them to the routing service.  \n\nBelow, I'm defining a function `points_to_coords()` to convert a given GeoDataFrame of points to a list of lists, with each list element representing the XY coordinates of a given input point in the dataset.  We'll then call the function on the Census tract centroids and the trauma hospitals datasets.  \n\n::: {.cell execution_count=8}\n``` {.python .cell-code}\n# Function to convert points to coordinates\ndef points_to_coords(input):\n  geom = input.to_crs(4326).geometry\n\n  return [[g.x, g.y] for g in geom]\n\n# Generate list of coordinates\ntract_coords = points_to_coords(tract_centroids)\nhospital_coords = points_to_coords(sd_trauma)\n```\n:::\n\n\nNext, we'll set up some custom code that allows for the creation of a 242 by 7 travel-time matrix.  This is necessary because Mapbox's Matrix API only allows for a maximum of 25 coordinate pairs per request, and we have 249 total!  Let's run the code, then walk through the steps we took.\n\n::: {.cell execution_count=9}\n``` {.python .cell-code}\nimport pandas as pd\n\nsplit_size = 25 - len(hospital_coords)\n\nchunks = [tract_coords[x:x + split_size] for x in range(0, len(tract_coords), split_size)]\n\ntimes_list = []\n\nfor chunk in chunks:\n\n  all_coords = chunk + hospital_coords\n\n  # Find the indices of origin and destination\n  origin_ix = [x for x in range(0, len(chunk), 1)]\n  hospital_ix = [y for y in range(len(chunk), len(all_coords), 1)]\n\n  # Run the travel-time matrix\n  times = mb.matrix(locations = all_coords,\n                    profile = \"driving\",\n                    sources = origin_ix,\n                    destinations = hospital_ix)\n\n  # Convert to a dataframe\n  times_df = pd.DataFrame(times.durations)\n\n  times_list.append(times_df)\n\nall_times = pd.concat(times_list, ignore_index = True) \n\nall_times.head()\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-display execution_count=9}\n```{=html}\n<div>\n<style scoped>\n    .dataframe tbody tr th:only-of-type {\n        vertical-align: middle;\n    }\n\n    .dataframe tbody tr th {\n        vertical-align: top;\n    }\n\n    .dataframe thead th {\n        text-align: right;\n    }\n</style>\n<table border=\"1\" class=\"dataframe\">\n  <thead>\n    <tr style=\"text-align: right;\">\n      <th></th>\n      <th>0</th>\n      <th>1</th>\n      <th>2</th>\n      <th>3</th>\n      <th>4</th>\n      <th>5</th>\n      <th>6</th>\n    </tr>\n  </thead>\n  <tbody>\n    <tr>\n      <th>0</th>\n      <td>7655.6</td>\n      <td>22608.1</td>\n      <td>22453.5</td>\n      <td>11990.2</td>\n      <td>20608.3</td>\n      <td>3551.9</td>\n      <td>3372.8</td>\n    </tr>\n    <tr>\n      <th>1</th>\n      <td>14506.5</td>\n      <td>15091.9</td>\n      <td>14937.3</td>\n      <td>12641.5</td>\n      <td>17750.0</td>\n      <td>10402.8</td>\n      <td>10223.7</td>\n    </tr>\n    <tr>\n      <th>2</th>\n      <td>10142.4</td>\n      <td>18571.4</td>\n      <td>18416.8</td>\n      <td>7929.9</td>\n      <td>22452.9</td>\n      <td>6038.7</td>\n      <td>5859.6</td>\n    </tr>\n    <tr>\n      <th>3</th>\n      <td>8893.4</td>\n      <td>21252.0</td>\n      <td>21097.4</td>\n      <td>16127.0</td>\n      <td>16477.4</td>\n      <td>4759.1</td>\n      <td>4610.6</td>\n    </tr>\n    <tr>\n      <th>4</th>\n      <td>27875.8</td>\n      <td>17600.7</td>\n      <td>17660.6</td>\n      <td>28882.6</td>\n      <td>3978.8</td>\n      <td>23741.5</td>\n      <td>23593.0</td>\n    </tr>\n  </tbody>\n</table>\n</div>\n```\n:::\n:::\n\n\nYou can interpret the code above as follows:\n\n* Given that we have far more coordinates than the Matrix API's limit of 25, we need to split up our origin coordinates into chunks.  We identify a `split_size` as 25 minus the number of hospitals (7); this is 18.  We then split the Census tract centroid coordinates into chunks of 18 using a list comprehension.\n* Next, we initialize a list to store our chunked output, and iterate through the chunks.  This process involves the following: \n  * We'll combine the list of origin coordinates (for a given chunk) and the hospital coordinates in the object `all_coords`;\n  * Next, we identify the indices of the origin coordinates and the hospital coordinates in `all_coords`. This is critical information that we'll need to pass along to the Mapbox Matrix API.  \n  * We use `mb.matrix()` to make a request to the Matrix API.  The request requires a list of coordinates; a travel profile; and the source and destination indices.  \n  * Once we get the results back, we'll create a __pandas__ DataFrame and append to `times_list`.  \n* Finally, we use `pd.concat()` to combine the chunked results into a single DataFrame, which you see above.  Values represent the drive-time in seconds between Census tract centroids and the trauma hospitals.\n\nOur last steps before plotting involve finding the minimum travel-time from each Census tract to a trauma hospital, converting to minutes, then adding back to the Census tracts GeoDataFrame as a column named `'time'`.  Using the GeoDataFrame method `.plot()` with some customization, we can reproduce the plot in _Analyzing US Census Data_.  \n\n::: {.cell execution_count=10}\n``` {.python .cell-code}\nmin_times = all_times.min(axis = \"columns\") / 60\n\nsd_tracts['time'] = min_times\n\nsd_tracts.plot(column = \"time\", legend = True, figsize = (8, 5),\n               cmap = \"magma\",\n               legend_kwds = {\"location\": \"top\",\n                              \"shrink\": 0.5})\n\nplt.title(\"Travel-time (minutes) to nearest\\nLevel I or Level II trauma hospital\\n\\n\\n\\n\")\n\nax = plt.gca()\n\nax.set_axis_off()\n\nax.annotate('Census tracts in South Dakota\\nData sources: US Census Bureau, US DHS, Mapbox', \n            xy=(0.1, 0.1), xycoords='figure fraction',\n            fontsize=8, ha='left', va='top')\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-display execution_count=10}\n```\nText(0.1, 0.1, 'Census tracts in South Dakota\\nData sources: US Census Bureau, US DHS, Mapbox')\n```\n:::\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-display}\n![](index_files/figure-html/cell-11-output-2.png){}\n:::\n:::\n\n\nThe map shows distinct gaps in accessibility to Level II trauma centers across the state of South Dakota.
