This long-awaited release includes data on workplaces, residences, and origin-destination flows for workers in 2020, along with a time series of these statistics back to 2002 enumerated at 2020 Census blocks.  \n\nThe latest release of the __pygris__ package for Python enables programmatic access to these new data resources with its `get_lodes()` function.  This new release also allows you to request Census geometry or longitude / latitude coordinates along with your LODES data, making data visualization and mapping straightforward.  Let's try it out!\n\n## Mapping job locations by Census block\n\nTo get started, let's take care of some imports.  We'll be using the following:\n\n- The `get_lodes()` function in the __pygris__ package gives us access to the brand-new LODES data.  There is a lot more you can do with `get_lodes()`; [review the package documentation for more examples](https://walker-data.com/pygris/03-data-utilities/#Accessing-LODES-data).  \n- __pydeck__ is a Python interface to [deck.gl, one of the most stunning data visualization libraries around](https://deck.gl/).  As you'll see, deck.gl can help you create performant three-dimensional visualizations with large datasets.  \n- We'll also use __matplotlib__ to do some custom color work for our maps.  \n\n```python\nfrom pygris.data import get_lodes\nimport pydeck\nimport matplotlib.pyplot as plt\nimport matplotlib.colors as mcolors\n\n```\n\nThe first example will visualize the distribution of accommodation and food service workers by Census block in Kentucky.  We can get this information from the LODES Worker Area Characteristics (WAC) dataset, which helps us understand the geography of jobs for small areas. \n\nThe latest version of __pygris__ (0.1.5) includes some mapping helpers in `get_lodes()`.  The new `return_geometry` parameter identifies the appropriate TIGER/Line shapefile to merge to the requested LODES data and returns a GeoPandas GeoDataFrame with geometry.  An alternative approach, which we will be using here, uses the new `return_lonlat` parameter.  This gives us a Pandas DataFrame with columns representing the centroid of the location.  This representation of geography works quite well with deck.gl.  \n\nLet's get WAC data for the state of Kentucky in 2020.\n\n```python\nky_lodes_wac = get_lodes(\n  state = \"KY\", \n  year = 2020, \n  lodes_type = \"wac\",\n  cache = True,\n  return_lonlat = True\n)\n```\n\nThe returned data have a host of columns representing jobs by category within that block, along with two additional columns, `w_lon` and `w_lat`, which represent the longitude and latitude of each block centroid.  \n\nOur next step is to write a color-generating function to add some context to our visualization.  For cartographers coming to deck.gl from other mapping libraries, color formatting can be tricky.  deck.gl expects RGBA colors with values ranging from 0 to 255; while many mapping libraries translate column values to colors for you, we'll need to do this manually.  \n\nThe function, `column_to_rgba()`, normalizes an input column and converts it to a column where every element is a list of format `[R, G, B, A]` for a given color map `cmap`.  We'll use this function to add a column to our dataset, `'color'`, that is based on values in the `CNS18` column (representing accommodation and food service jobs) and uses the viridis color palette.\n\n```python\ndef column_to_rgba(column, cmap, alpha):\n    normalized = (column - column.min()) / (column.max() - column.min())\n    my_cmap = plt.get_cmap(cmap)\n    colors = normalized.apply(lambda x: [int(i * 255) for i in mcolors.to_rgba(my_cmap(x, alpha = alpha))])\n\n    return colors\n  \n  \nky_lodes_wac['color'] = column_to_rgba(ky_lodes_wac['CNS18'], \"viridis\", 0.6)\n```\n\nThe longitude / latitude data will work well for a [deck.gl ColumnLayer](https://deck.gl/gallery/column-layer).  A column layer is a three-dimensional visualization that renders each location as a column, with height and color optionally scaled to a given characteristic in the dataset.  This is a nice alternative to a choropleth map of jobs by block, as block polygons can be very irregular.  \n\n```python\nlayer = pydeck.Layer(\n  \"ColumnLayer\",\n  ky_lodes_wac,\n  get_position=[\"w_lon\", \"w_lat\"],\n  auto_highlight=True,\n  elevation_scale=20,\n  pickable=True,\n  get_elevation = \"CNS18\",\n  get_fill_color = \"color\",\n  elevation_range=[0, 1000],\n  extruded=True,\n  coverage=1\n)\n\n# Set the viewport location\nview_state = pydeck.ViewState(\n  longitude=-85.4095567,\n  latitude=37.2086276,\n  zoom=6,\n  min_zoom=5,\n  max_zoom=15,\n  pitch=40.5,\n  bearing=-27.36\n)\n\ntooltip = {\"html\": \"Number of accommodation / food service jobs: {CNS18}\"}\n\n# Render\nr = pydeck.Deck(\n  layers=[layer], \n  initial_view_state=view_state, \n  map_style = \"light\", \n  tooltip = tooltip\n)\n\nr.to_html(\"ky_service.html\")\n```\n\nBrowse the map and look for interesting patterns.  Note how seamlessly deck.gl visualizes all 30,000 block locations in the dataset!\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n<iframe src=\"ky_service.html\" width=\"100%\" height=\"600px\" data-external=\"1\"></iframe>\n:::\n\n\n\n## Mapping origin-destination flows\n\nThe `return_lonlat` feature in `get_lodes()` also works great for representing origin-destination flows.  The origin-destination dataset in LODES, acquired with `lodes_type = \"od\"`, returns block-to-block flows for all home-to-work combinations in a given state.  \n\nGiven that block-to-block flows could quickly get visually overwhelming, we may want to aggregate our data to a parent geography.  Let's acquire origin-destination flows for the state of Texas, and aggregate to the Census tract level with the argument `agg_level = \"tract\"`.  \n\n```python\ntx_od = get_lodes(\n  state = \"TX\", \n  year = 2020, \n  lodes_type=\"od\",\n  agg_level = \"tract\",\n  cache = True, \n  return_lonlat = True\n)\n```\n\nThe data we get back includes `h_lon` and `h_lat` columns representing the centroid of the home Census tract, and `w_lon` and `w_lat` columns for the centroid of the work Census tract.  \n\nWe'll visualize these flows with a [deck.gl ArcLayer](https://deckgl.readthedocs.io/en/latest/gallery/arc_layer.html); incidentally, the PyDeck documentation uses LODES data to show how ArcLayers work.  \n\nLet's refine the data first to answer a specific question.  I live in Fort Worth, Texas, and a major growth area for the city is [AllianceTexas](https://www.alliancetexas.com/), a fast-developing industrial and commercial corridor.  We'll generate a new object, `top_commutes`, that identifies those Census tracts sending at least 25 commuters to the Census tract containing the southern part of the Alliance airport.  \n\n```python\ntop_commutes = tx_od.query('w_geocode == \"48439113932\" & S000 >= 25')\n\n```\n\nFrom here, we can basically replicate the example from the PyDeck documentation, but apply it to commute flows to Alliance in Fort Worth.  \n\n```python\nimport pydeck\n\nGREEN_RGB = [0, 255, 0, 200]\nRED_RGB = [240, 100, 0, 200]\n\narc_layer = pydeck.Layer(\n  \"ArcLayer\",\n  data=top_commutes,\n  get_width=\"S000 / 5\",\n  get_source_position=[\"h_lon\", \"h_lat\"],\n  get_target_position=[\"w_lon\", \"w_lat\"],\n  get_tilt=15,\n  get_source_color=RED_RGB,\n  get_target_color=GREEN_RGB,\n  pickable=True,\n  auto_highlight=True\n)\n\nview_state = pydeck.ViewState(\n  latitude=32.708664, \n  longitude=-97.360546, \n  bearing=45, \n  pitch=50, \n  zoom=8\n)\n\ntooltip = {\"html\": \"{S000} jobs <br /> Home of commuter in red; work location in green\"}\nr = pydeck.Deck(\n  arc_layer, \n  initial_view_state=view_state, \n  tooltip=tooltip, \n  map_style = \"road\"\n)\n\nr.to_html(\"alliance_commuters.html\")\n```\n\nWe get a compelling origin-destination flow map showing the locations that sent the most commuters to AllianceTexas in 2020.  \n\n\n::: {.cell}\n<iframe src=\"alliance_commuters.html\" width=\"100%\" height=\"600px\" data-external=\"1\"></iframe>\n:::\n\n\n\nWorking with LODES data can have massive benefits for your projects and your business.
