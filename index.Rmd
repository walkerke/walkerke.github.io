Welcome!  I'm Kyle Walker, and here is some information about my current work: 

* I'm an R developer actively working on the following packages: 
  * [tidycensus](https://github.com/walkerke/tidycensus), which helps R users get demographic & spatial data from the US Census Bureau ready-to-go for use in their analyses;
  * [tigris](https://github.com/walkerke/tigris), which downloads US Census Bureau spatial data and loads it directly into R as simple features objects;
  * [mapboxapi](https://github.com/walkerke/mapboxapi), an R interface to [Mapbox web services](https://docs.mapbox.com/api/).  Use the package to optimize routes, draw isochrones, read and write vector tiles, use custom Mapbox maps in Leaflet projects, and more;
  * [crsuggest](https://github.com/walkerke/crsuggest), which gives R users projected coordinate system suggestions for their spatial datasets.  
* I'm an [academic](http://personal.tcu.edu/kylewalker/) researching [data science](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s40980-018-0042-7) and [visualization tools for spatial demography](http://personal.tcu.edu/kylewalker/immigrant-america/#11/41.8643/-87.6307).  I'm currently teaching courses in [exploratory data analysis with Python](https://github.com/walkerke/geog30323) and [introductory Urban Studies](https://github.com/walkerke/urbanslides). 
* I am Director of Research at a boutique data science and strategy firm, where we use cutting-edge geospatial & machine learning methods to improve companies' business outcomes.  
* I also take on small consulting projects through my personal firm, Walker Data, where I help clients learn R for their personal and professional projects.  

If you are interested in working with me, send me a note at <kyle@walker-data.com> and let's discuss your idea!
