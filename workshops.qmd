> One thing that really stood out was how you shared your own workflow through real-life examples. Seeing the direct application of tidycensus to our day-to-day tasks was a game-changer. It's safe to say that we're all feeling a lot more confident about integrating these techniques into our work.

> Your assistance in streamlining some of our existing workflows was a huge bonus. It's not just the "how-to" that's valuable, but also the practical insights you provided.

> Your excitement about the whole topic was infectious. It's not easy to keep a group engaged all day, but you nailed it. Your enthusiasm made a huge difference.
