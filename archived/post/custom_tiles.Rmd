Yesterday, I posted to Twitter an interactive map using the classic [John Snow Cholera dataset](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1854_Broad_Street_cholera_outbreak) and tiles made from Snow's map, which attracted a fair share of interest.

I was inspired to try this by [Lincoln Mullen's tweet](https://twitter.com/lincolnmullen/status/573958380114604032) that custom historical tiles could be used in an RStudio Leaflet map.  Incidentally, I am teaching students in my [Advanced GIS course at TCU](http://personal.tcu.edu/kylewalker/assets/advancedgis.pdf) about tiled mapping next week; I was (and still am) going to use MapBox Studio as an example, but I thought this might work as a compelling example as well, especially as I assigned my students a lab assignment earlier in the semester in which they made kernel density maps from the Snow data.  

Below, I'll explain how I got this done.  My data come from the [Yale University Library's GIS Workshop Archive](http://guides.library.yale.edu/gisworkshoparchive), in which they generously make the John Snow data publicly available.  However, the data are stored in an Esri File Geodatabase, for which there does not appear to be an open-source solution to get rasters out of yet; as such, I've placed the John Snow map image as a GeoTIFF and the deaths point data as a shapefile in [this GitHub repository](https://github.com/walkerke/teaching-with-datavis/tree/master/snow_data).  The Snow map is already __georectified__, which means that it has been georeferenced to a coordinate system and exported as a geographic dataset.  I'm not going to go over georeferencing here if you are working with a plain image; [you can read more about how to do that in QGIS here](http://www.qgistutorials.com/en/docs/georeferencing_basics.html).  

To get started, I needed to create __tiles__ from my image.  Modern web maps in the style of Google Maps employ tiled mapping to render basemaps quickly; [you can read more about tiled mapping here](https://www.e-education.psu.edu/geog585/node/706).  In a nutshell, tiled maps are tessellations of 256px by 256px images that are referenced based on their zoom level and coordinates.  

To create tiles from my John Snow map image, I used the [gdal2tiles](http://www.gdal.org/gdal2tiles.html) utility.  gdal2tiles is a command-line tool available within the [Geospatial Data Abstraction Library](http://www.gdal.org/index.html), which is a suite of command-line functions for manipulating geographic data.  Fortunately, if you have QGIS on your machine, you have GDAL installed.  The easiest way to access it is to open the __OSGeo4W Shell__ where your QGIS installation is located, which will give you access to the tools.  

In the OSGeo4W shell, I `cd` into my directory where my John Snow image is located and enter the following command: 

```
gdal2tiles -s EPSG:32630 -z 14-18 snow.tif snow

```

The `-s` option refers to the input coordinate system of the georectified image; mine is in WGS84 UTM Zone 30N, which has the EPSG code of 32630.  The `-z` option governs the zoom levels for which tiles will be generated; as my map covers a relatively small area, I'm sticking with zoom levels 14 to 18.  I then specify an input image file ('snow.tif') and an output directory that I am calling `snow` which the function will create for me.  

After the tool is finished running, I have a directory, `snow`, that is populated with PNG images, organized by their zoom level and coordinates.  My `snow` directory looks like this: 

```
+---14
|   +---8185
|   \---8186
+---15
|   +---16370
|   +---16371
|   \---16372
+---16
|   +---32741
|   +---32742
|   +---32743
|   \---32744
+---17
|   +---65483
|   +---65484
|   +---65485
|   +---65486
|   +---65487
|   \---65488
\---18
    +---130966
    +---130967
    +---130968
    +---130969
    +---130970
    +---130971
    +---130972
    +---130973
    +---130974
    +---130975
    +---130976
    \---130977
```
I have a folder for each zoom level, organized into sub-folders that are designated by their tile X coordinates.  Within each of these subfolders are PNG images, the tiles themselves, that are named by their tile Y coordinates. Here's an example of a tile, "174980.png" at 18/130970/174980: 

![tile image](https://dl.dropbox.com/s/3ift20yrw2lu9l2/174980.png)

Now, I need a place to host my tiles so they can be consumed by a web mapping API like Leaflet.  To do this, I've created a [GitHub repository](https://github.com/walkerke/tiles) and published the tiles using GitHub Pages, which is what I use to host [my data visualization blog](http://walkerke.github.io/).  

I'm now ready to create my map in RStudio!  I'm just creating a basic map with the Snow map as a basemap, circles sized proportionately to the number of cholera deaths at a given location, and a pop-up on click that shows the number of deaths.  The code below gets this done: 

```{r, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}

library(leaflet)
library(rgdal)

dir <- getwd()

deaths <- readOGR(dir, "deaths", verbose = FALSE)

deathsxy <- spTransform(deaths, CRS("+proj=longlat +datum=WGS84"))

circle_popup <- paste0("<strong>Address: </strong>", 
                      deathsxy$Address, 
                      "<br><strong>Number of deaths: </strong>", 
                      deathsxy$Num_Cases)

leaflet() %>%
  setView(-0.1354223, 51.5135085, zoom = 17) %>%
  addTiles(urlTemplate = "http://walkerke.github.io/tiles/snow/{z}/{x}/{y}.png",
           attribution = 'Data source: <a href="http://guides.library.yale.edu/gisworkshoparchive">Yale University Library</a>', 
           options = tileOptions(minZoom = 15, maxZoom = 18, tms = TRUE)) %>%
  addCircles(data = deathsxy, 
             radius = deathsxy$Num_Cases, 
             popup = circle_popup, 
             color = "red", 
             fillColor = "red")

```

I won't go into detail here about the syntax for the spatial data; [check my other RPubs for tutorials on how to get spatial data into Leaflet](http://rpubs.com/walkerke).  I will, however, explain how I incorporate my custom tiles.  Note the `addTiles` function with the `urlTemplate` parameter.  This allows you to use tiles other than the default OpenStreetMap tileset.  The key is, then, to specify how the tiles will be retrieved.  I use the following URL: 

```
http://walkerke.github.io/tiles/snow/{z}/{x}/{y}.png
```

Notice how `z`, `x`, and `y` are enclosed within curly braces; this allows these values to vary as the user pans and zooms around the map.  Depending on the zoom level and extent of the map, Leaflet will retrieve appropriate tiles; notice how this corresponds to the names of my directories and images in my `snow` folder.  Incorporating other external tilesets in your maps works similarly; [see this GitHub Gist for the syntax for some popular ones](https://gist.github.com/walkerke/12a737c4d87aca2ecc70).  Of course, you should always cite your sources afterward, which can be accomplished with the `attribution` parameter.  Finally, if you have generated your tiles with gdal2tiles, be sure to set the `tms` parameter to `TRUE` with `tileOptions`, or else your tiles won't show up.  

If you have any comments or questions, please let me know!
