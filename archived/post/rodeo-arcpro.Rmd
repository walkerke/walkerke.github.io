Recently, I had a need to automate some GIS operations using [ArcGIS Pro](https://pro.arcgis.com/en/pro-app/) and the [ArcPy Python site package](http://pro.arcgis.com/en/pro-app/arcpy/get-started/what-is-arcpy-.htm).  As of version 1.3, ArcGIS Pro ships with Anaconda as its Python installation, which makes it easier to work with ArcGIS as part of a broader data science workflow.  I wanted to do my work in my Python IDE of choice, [Yhat's Rodeo](http://rodeo.yhat.com/); however, this didn't work out of the box.  I'm sharing the process I used to connect Rodeo to ArcGIS Pro's Anaconda Python 3.  

For IDEs to access ArcGIS Pro licensing regardless of whether or not you have an internet connection, you'll need to enable offline access.  Click the __Projects__ tab in ArcGIS Pro, then choose the __Settings__ option; scroll down and check the appropriate box.

Next, click the __Python__ option from the menu on the left.  From here, search for the __jupyter__ package and install it, which should install Jupyter and its associated libraries.  This step is necessary to get Rodeo to work with ArcGIS Pro.

Now, launch your Rodeo application, and click __Rodeo > Preferences__ to switch its [conda environment](http://rodeo.yhat.com/docs/#using-conda-environments).  Click the __Python__ tab, and change your Python Command by navigating to the Python executable associated with the __arcgispro-py3__ conda environment; you can find it where ArcGIS Pro is installed on your machine in `ArcGIS\Pro\bin\Python\envs\arcgispro-py3\`.

Click OK, import __arcpy__, and write scripts to automate ArcGIS as usual!
