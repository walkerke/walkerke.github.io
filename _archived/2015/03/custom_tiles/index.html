<p>Yesterday, I posted to Twitter an interactive map using the classic <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1854_Broad_Street_cholera_outbreak">John Snow Cholera dataset</a> and tiles made from Snow’s map, which attracted a fair share of interest.</p>

<p>I was inspired to try this by <a href="https://twitter.com/lincolnmullen/status/573958380114604032">Lincoln Mullen’s tweet</a> that custom historical tiles could be used in an RStudio Leaflet map. Incidentally, I am teaching students in my <a href="http://personal.tcu.edu/kylewalker/assets/advancedgis.pdf">Advanced GIS course at TCU</a> about tiled mapping next week; I was (and still am) going to use MapBox Studio as an example, but I thought this might work as a compelling example as well, especially as I assigned my students a lab assignment earlier in the semester in which they made kernel density maps from the Snow data.</p>
<p>Below, I’ll explain how I got this done. My data come from the <a href="http://guides.library.yale.edu/gisworkshoparchive">Yale University Library’s GIS Workshop Archive</a>, in which they generously make the John Snow data publicly available. However, the data are stored in an Esri File Geodatabase, for which there does not appear to be an open-source solution to get rasters out of yet; as such, I’ve placed the John Snow map image as a GeoTIFF and the deaths point data as a shapefile in <a href="https://github.com/walkerke/teaching-with-datavis/tree/master/snow_data">this GitHub repository</a>. The Snow map is already <strong>georectified</strong>, which means that it has been georeferenced to a coordinate system and exported as a geographic dataset. I’m not going to go over georeferencing here if you are working with a plain image; <a href="http://www.qgistutorials.com/en/docs/georeferencing_basics.html">you can read more about how to do that in QGIS here</a>.</p>
<p>To get started, I needed to create <strong>tiles</strong> from my image. Modern web maps in the style of Google Maps employ tiled mapping to render basemaps quickly; <a href="https://www.e-education.psu.edu/geog585/node/706">you can read more about tiled mapping here</a>. In a nutshell, tiled maps are tessellations of 256px by 256px images that are referenced based on their zoom level and coordinates.</p>
<p>To create tiles from my John Snow map image, I used the <a href="http://www.gdal.org/gdal2tiles.html">gdal2tiles</a> utility. gdal2tiles is a command-line tool available within the <a href="http://www.gdal.org/index.html">Geospatial Data Abstraction Library</a>, which is a suite of command-line functions for manipulating geographic data. Fortunately, if you have QGIS on your machine, you have GDAL installed. The easiest way to access it is to open the <strong>OSGeo4W Shell</strong> where your QGIS installation is located, which will give you access to the tools.</p>
<p>In the OSGeo4W shell, I <code>cd</code> into my directory where my John Snow image is located and enter the following command:</p>
<pre><code>gdal2tiles -s EPSG:32630 -z 14-18 snow.tif snow
</code></pre>
<p>The <code>-s</code> option refers to the input coordinate system of the georectified image; mine is in WGS84 UTM Zone 30N, which has the EPSG code of 32630. The <code>-z</code> option governs the zoom levels for which tiles will be generated; as my map covers a relatively small area, I’m sticking with zoom levels 14 to 18. I then specify an input image file (‘snow.tif’) and an output directory that I am calling <code>snow</code> which the function will create for me.</p>
<p>After the tool is finished running, I have a directory, <code>snow</code>, that is populated with PNG images, organized by their zoom level and coordinates. My <code>snow</code> directory looks like this:</p>
<pre><code>+---14
|   +---8185
|   \---8186
+---15
|   +---16370
|   +---16371
|   \---16372
+---16
|   +---32741
|   +---32742
|   +---32743
|   \---32744
+---17
|   +---65483
|   +---65484
|   +---65485
|   +---65486
|   +---65487
|   \---65488
\---18
    +---130966
    +---130967
    +---130968
    +---130969
    +---130970
    +---130971
    +---130972
    +---130973
    +---130974
    +---130975
    +---130976
    \---130977</code></pre>
<p>I have a folder for each zoom level, organized into sub-folders that are designated by their tile X coordinates. Within each of these subfolders are PNG images, the tiles themselves, that are named by their tile Y coordinates. Here’s an example of a tile, “174980.png” at 18/130970/174980:</p>
<div class="figure">
<img src="https://dl.dropbox.com/s/3ift20yrw2lu9l2/174980.png" alt="tile image" />
<p class="caption">tile image</p>
</div>
<p>Now, I need a place to host my tiles so they can be consumed by a web mapping API like Leaflet. To do this, I’ve created a <a href="https://github.com/walkerke/tiles">GitHub repository</a> and published the tiles using GitHub Pages, which is what I use to host <a href="http://walkerke.github.io/">my data visualization blog</a>.</p>
<p>I’m now ready to create my map in RStudio! I’m just creating a basic map with the Snow map as a basemap, circles sized proportionately to the number of cholera deaths at a given location, and a pop-up on click that shows the number of deaths. The code below gets this done:</p>
<pre class="r"><code>library(leaflet)
library(rgdal)

dir &lt;- getwd()

deaths &lt;- readOGR(dir, &quot;deaths&quot;, verbose = FALSE)

deathsxy &lt;- spTransform(deaths, CRS(&quot;+proj=longlat +datum=WGS84&quot;))

circle_popup &lt;- paste0(&quot;&lt;strong&gt;Address: &lt;/strong&gt;&quot;, 
                      deathsxy$Address, 
                      &quot;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Number of deaths: &lt;/strong&gt;&quot;, 
                      deathsxy$Num_Cases)

leaflet() %&gt;%
  setView(-0.1354223, 51.5135085, zoom = 17) %&gt;%
  addTiles(urlTemplate = &quot;http://walkerke.github.io/tiles/snow/{z}/{x}/{y}.png&quot;,
           attribution = &#39;Data source: &lt;a href=&quot;http://guides.library.yale.edu/gisworkshoparchive&quot;&gt;Yale University Library&lt;/a&gt;&#39;, 
           options = tileOptions(minZoom = 15, maxZoom = 18, tms = TRUE)) %&gt;%
  addCircles(data = deathsxy, 
             radius = deathsxy$Num_Cases, 
             popup = circle_popup, 
             color = &quot;red&quot;, 
             fillColor = &quot;red&quot;)</code></pre>

<p>I won’t go into detail here about the syntax for the spatial data; <a href="http://rpubs.com/walkerke">check my other RPubs for tutorials on how to get spatial data into Leaflet</a>. I will, however, explain how I incorporate my custom tiles. Note the <code>addTiles</code> function with the <code>urlTemplate</code> parameter. This allows you to use tiles other than the default OpenStreetMap tileset. The key is, then, to specify how the tiles will be retrieved. I use the following URL:</p>
<pre><code>http://walkerke.github.io/tiles/snow/{z}/{x}/{y}.png</code></pre>
<p>Notice how <code>z</code>, <code>x</code>, and <code>y</code> are enclosed within curly braces; this allows these values to vary as the user pans and zooms around the map. Depending on the zoom level and extent of the map, Leaflet will retrieve appropriate tiles; notice how this corresponds to the names of my directories and images in my <code>snow</code> folder. Incorporating other external tilesets in your maps works similarly; <a href="https://gist.github.com/walkerke/12a737c4d87aca2ecc70">see this GitHub Gist for the syntax for some popular ones</a>. Of course, you should always cite your sources afterward, which can be accomplished with the <code>attribution</code> parameter. Finally, if you have generated your tiles with gdal2tiles, be sure to set the <code>tms</code> parameter to <code>TRUE</code> with <code>tileOptions</code>, or else your tiles won’t show up.</p>
<p>If you have any comments or questions, please let me know!</p>
